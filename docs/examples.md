# Examples

We provide usage examples under `guiy-examples` in the project repo.
These show both how to include guiy in gradle and depend on it as a paper plugin, and contain different menus showcasing
guiy's features.

## Real-world examples

These are notable projects using guiy-compose that you can use as a reference.
Most are used internally at Mine in Abyss, however feel free to reach out to us on Discord if you'd like to add your own open source project here.

| [Mine in Abyss plugin](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/MineInAbyss/tree/master/mineinabyss-features/src/main/kotlin/com/mineinabyss/features/guilds/menus) | Uses guiy for most of our menus, the largest of which is our guild system. We are working to rewrite this using android architecture standards, please only use this as a general reference for composables, not state management. |
